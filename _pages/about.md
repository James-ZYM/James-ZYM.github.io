##### **Hi, thanks for stopping by👋!<br>My name is James Yiming Zhu (朱一铭).**
---
I am a **final-year Ph.D.** at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) researching in the [MC2 Lab](https://mc2-lab-hkust.netlify.app/), supervised by [<ins>Prof. Pan Hui</ins>](https://panhui.people.ust.hk/) and [<ins>Prof. James Tin-Yau KWOK</ins>](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~jamesk/). Meanwhile, I have been co-working with [<ins>Prof. Gareth Tyson</ins>](https://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~tysong/) and [<ins>Prof. Lik-Hang Lee</ins>](https://www.lhlee.com/). Previously, I completed my undergraduate degree in Computer Science and Technology at University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) and then served as a one-year research assistant supervised by [<ins>Prof. Cheng Li</ins>](https://mr-cheng-li.github.io/).

My research interests lie in **social computing**, **data science**, and **natural language processing**. Standing at the
intersection of the big data and AI era, I mainly focus on investigating how emerging generative AI (GenAI) technologies are
reshaping the Internet ecosystem and online social networks. Additionally, I am passionate about addressing practical
challenges related to GenAI misuse, helping platform developers enhance moderation and mitigate harmful AI
applications.

**🔥🔥Ongoing research🔥🔥:**
- Authoring a systematic literture review of attacking and defensing techniques for GenAI-powered online harms.
- Leading a project constructing a benchmark for evaluating exsisting LLM emsemble methods in social data annotation tasks.
- Co-working with Prof. Gareth Tyson to develop a document ranking framework driven by multiple personalized LLM agents.
